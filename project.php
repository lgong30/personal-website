				          <p align="justify">BibTex as a a file format which is used to manage references, providing us a lot of convenience. From a BibTex file, we can easily generate the list of references as we want. However, sometimes, the reverse direction, i.e., from lists of references back to BibTex file, is also needed, but it is not that easy. In this project, we focus on the reverse direction.</p>

				          <h2>Bookmarks for eBooks</h2>
				          <p align="justify">In a physical book, it is very convenient to locate the content you need by using table of contents (TOC). However, in ebooks, it seems that bookmarks are more convenient than TOC. Unfortunately, although almost all books have TOCs, a lot of ebooks do not have bookmarks. A very natural thinking is whether we can easily construct a lists of bookmarks from the TOC. In this project, we focus on tackling such a problem.</p>
